xJoyMap: Wants to be a simple way to modify
datarefs with your joystick and/or creating
advanced combined commands

It can also be used to change the behavior
of your joystick between aircraft changes without
visiting the joy config pane (see the x737 config example)

It can be useful for cockpit builders who want 
to assign dozens of buttons and switches without having to 
write their own plug-ins.

Please share your config files with the community

Please feel free to post your patches, bugs and contributions
at http://github.com/joanpc/xJoyMap

=============
Installation
=============

You need the awesome PYTHON INTERFACE PLUGIN 
http://www.xpluginsdk.org/python_interface.htm

Copy PI_xJoyMap.py and xJoyMap.ini to your 
Resources/plugins/PythonScripts directory.

Edit xJoyMap.ini to fit your needs

If you want specific commands for an aircraft
copy xJoyMap.ini to the aircraft folder and modify it.

Enjoy
